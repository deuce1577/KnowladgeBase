often consists of learning what not to learn. That’s so often the case in this business. Here it is in black and white: soybeans topped out on an increasing OI. That’s not what the books teach about the markets, but then, books don’t trade.

In Figure 8.2, the April 2001 low in soybeans developed on what is supposed to be bearish—a decline in price while there is a large increase in OI. Typical tea-leaf readers of OI would say a downtrend with increasing open interest means shorts are adding to their positions while longs (the losers in this case) are still increasing their longs. So the shorts are in control, and a further decline is to be expected. How can it be that OI picks up dramatically just before the market bottoms—that while the price is falling there is a pickup of interest in this market? That’s not the model that we are told markets follow.

Two months later, though, soybeans do what they are supposed to: price declines, as does OI, telling us new shorts are not being added.

Hence an up move can be expected, and that’s just what happens. It’s the placebo effect at work. There’s nothing harder to unlearn than what seems to be the truth when it is only random luck. This is the typical bullish pattern that has been passed down from one generation of market watchers to the next. As you can see, at times it does work.

Randomness, the great muse of all market players, is one tough cookie to deal with. I have been fooled by this flirtatious siren more times than I care to admit. We see two things together, then notice an apparent cause or effect from that coupling. The truth is that the outcome was FIGURE 8.2

caused by some third party hiding behind a tree, or by no explainable cause at all.

So, these authors and advisers can find examples to validate their beliefs. But just as often, if not more so, we can find the opposite to be equally true. All this is well and good and makes for interesting discussion. Yet the lack of consistency is something I cannot put up with as one who ekes out a living trading, not writing for fun and pleasure. I know I’m not going to be right all the time, but dang it all, I’d like to be right more than 30 percent of the time! And I’d like to see under scrutiny some consistency. Why the discrepancy? Simple, one key point is sadly missing in standard OI analysis.

OPEN INTEREST AS A TIMING OR ENTRY TOOL

As you recall, earlier I touched on the point that OI gives us a good idea of how many swimmers are in the pool. In this business of speculating, when everyone is in the pool the market is closer to a turning point, usually down. By the same token, when no one is in the pool, it’s a great time to get in and usually markets rally. There is a natural reason for this. Price action (trend) attracts buyers and short sellers. Hence there is almost always an increase of players (OI) on rallies. When a market has become dull (no price moves), investors shy away. But, as you will soon see, that is usually the wrong thing to do. More market bottoms and excellent buy points have been formed when OI is low than at any other time. Equally true is this statement: more market highs have been made when OI is higher than at any other time.

Low OI means that the public and funds have lost interest in this particular market. Their attention and money have been diverted elsewhere. Since I live and die by the notion the public is wrong (I know this from personal experience; they voted for some other guy to be their United States Senator from Montana. See how wrong they can be!), the fact that the public is not interested in a market means I should be. Of course this is just a concept, a concept though that I can prove to you, thanks to the record of OI.

MY OPEN INTEREST INDICATOR

Realizing this means we can begin to put OI into perspective and use it to help us select markets ready to rally or decline. I’ll start this lesson with soybeans, a popular trading market. Noting the indicator in Figure 8.3, the price action is simply a 12-month stochastic of OI. What we are looking at www.fx1618.com

here is not price, not the commercials, not the public, and not the large traders. Simply put, we are looking at the ebb and tide of total speculative interest in soybeans. What is apparent is that when there is little speculative interest, the market is a better buy than the other way around.

This is not an anomaly to soybeans. It is a truism of all markets. As an example I’ll next proffer up gold (see Figure 8.4). While a low OI indication FIGURE 8.4

does not mark every bottom, every good buy point is concurrent with a low OI reading. Get that? While at times OI does not call the exact low (I wish it was that easy), we can still pretty much rest assured that almost all lows will come hand in glove with this important market indication. This is like the comment that all cognac is brandy, but not all brandy is cognac. In short, we can narrow down times to look for major plays in the market . . .

and that’s a huge advantage.

Let’s look at a few more markets to drive home this point, and discuss what markets this does not work in—notably stock index futures. The financial markets have a much different OI pattern as there is no physical crop of stocks or British pounds to bring to the marketplace, so the interest in the market is synthetic and involves a great deal of arbitrage between markets. This accounts for spikes in OI close to delivery, with a large buildup of OI, then a sharp drop-off as the new contract begins trading. Nonetheless, as Figure 8.5, a chart of the pound, shows, the idea of a low OI reading has great merit.

Even such thin and mundane markets as lumber respond to this phenomenon of lack of interest as a warning to the speculator to get interested. (See Figure 8.6.) While far from perfect (nothing is perfect in this business), the notion of low OI is one that sets up many excellent buying points, while a high OI reading in this index usually precedes market tops.

different set of problems due to the liquidation of the contracts four times per year at expiration. Figure 8.7 shows a recent example of that so you can see for yourself, and learn not to rely on OI by itself for these contracts.

We will have to attack the stock market from a different direction.

What should be apparent here, however, is that most of the major sell-offs FIGURE 8.7

began with a high OI level, a point to keep in mind. In many ways this is like contrary opinion: the notion that the crowd can never be right, and that when the majority is of one mind they are most apt to be wrong.

While that idea gives great solace to guys like John Kerry or Richard Nixon, it gives even more comfort to a trader to be able to know, based on actual numbers, what the crowd is doing so that we do not follow them over the cliff leading to speculative ruins.

SELLS IN SILVER

Let’s look at a long-term chart of silver and the OI indicator. It takes only a glance at Figure 8.8 to see that the major highs in this market came at a time when OI was high.

This is not a recent phenomenon of silver and OI. As you can see from Figure 8.9, the next weekly chart going back to 1993 (so we have covered the last 12 years), the same pattern was alive and well back then as it is now. High OI levels are associated with market peaks and low levels with market bottoms.

Finally, to drive the point home Figure 8.10 shows silver all the way back to 1985, where again we see the same operative rule. Etch this one into your skull. Write it in on your chart book. High levels of OI, as measured by a one-year stochastic indicator, are bearish and are usually seen shortly before a significant top.
